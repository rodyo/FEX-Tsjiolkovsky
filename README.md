# FEX-Tsjiolkovsky

TSJIOLKOVSKY is basically an implementation of all possible ways to solve Tsjiolkovsky's equation, once the three other parameters are known.
TSJIOLKOVSKY is vectorized in the sense that all non-empty inputs may
be arrays of any dimension. TSJIOLKOVSKY will compute the corresponding
values for the requested output, with singleton expansion enabled.
